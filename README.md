Data analysis project on real-world musician booking for events.

👋 **Hi there! I'm Kaur Lal Devi!**
I'm currently focused on becoming a Data Analyst! I'm excited about this process and the chance to build an active, public portfolio here on GitHub.

📊 **About this Project**
This project is a hands-on Data Analysis exercise using real-world event booking data (for musicians). My main goal is to show how I can take raw data and turn it into clear information to help a business grow. What you will see here: I'm documenting every step of the data lifecycle. Check the file updates (the 'commit history') to follow my process

🚀 **Let's Connect!**
I believe we learn best by doing and sharing. I will upload big changes often, so you can see how the analysis evolves. I'm always open to kind feedback and learning from my mistakes!

I am actively looking for Data Analyst jobs and opportunities. Let's connect—I'm ready to bring my dedication to your team!
