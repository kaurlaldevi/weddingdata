# FULL DOCUMENTATION (README / EXTENDED COMMENT)

Hello everyone! I'm sharing the latest updates on the Bodas.net data analysis.

The journey has been the best lesson. When I started with this dataset, I immediately ran into the BLANK PAGE SYNDROME: Where should I begin? This led me to redo and reorganize the work several times. The key has been working SMARTER, not harder.

The main challenge wasn't the formula, but the visualization and the approach. I wasn't satisfied with how the data was being presented, which prevented me from moving forward.

### Key Solutions Implemented

* Invisible Duplicates Solved: I eliminated duplicate leads by ignoring the time component and searching for duplicates based on Date and Customer Name.
* Date Format Corrected: I resolved conflicts between the DD/MM/YYYY format and the English software configuration, standardizing the month display (e.g., Nov-24).
* Visual Order Achieved: I fixed the alphabetical ordering of months in the Pivot Table by using the Month Sort Key column to enforce chronological sorting.

### Major Takeaways

1.  DEFINE THE SCOPE: I learned the importance of clearly defining the analysis question and the exact time frame (Nov 07, 2024 to Nov 07, 2025) before starting any processing.
2.  WORK WITH PIVOT TABLES: I switched from time-consuming custom formulas to using Pivot Tables. It's about working smart, not hard.
3.  ORGANIZE THE FLOW: Following the steps from the Data Analytics course (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share) makes the work much easier to execute and explain.
4.  INTEGRATE AI SMARTLY: AI is a GAME CHANGER. By repeatedly asking the tool to fix my errors and clarify doubts, I am learning the necessary steps much faster.

The next phase will focus on in-depth analysis: calculating the conversion rate by month, segmenting requests by lead time, and determining optimal promotions.
